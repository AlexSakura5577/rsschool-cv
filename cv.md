# __About Me__

#### *Hi. I am 33 years old. I got interested in IT a long time ago. I majored in software engineering at the university about 10 years ago, but I left it without getting a degree.

I am currently learning JavaScript from tutorials and YouTube videos. In my free time I'm occupied with my personal growth and psychology. My hobby is music.*
#### *My long-term goal is to become a professional full-stack developer, in order to create websites, games and applications of any complexity quickly and with high quality.
